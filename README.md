### Welcome to the Updated BC Liqour App
First a concession: I apologize, I completed this assignment by the old rules before Lucy posted about the change in Canvas, so my app is not novel but contains several updates to Dean Attalis original BC Liquour App as created in his shiny tutorial.

This app allows users to use widgets to navegate through the BC Liquour inventory according to multiple different criterion (price, country, alcohol %, type, and subtype). Results will be displayed as a historgram to view the distribution of products based on user selection and as a list of all products that fit user selected criteria. 

There a multiple updates from the original BC Liquor App:
1) A dropdown widget to select drink **subtype** which varies according to drink **type** selection from the radio buttons.
2) An 'ALL' option has been added to the **country** and **subtype** dropdown widgets to allow for more robust navigation as the original country selection was pretty limiting.
3) Added a graphic of two cool little beer guys hanging out in the sidebar panel.
4) changed the histogram appearance to include a wider range of prices and to a more exciting yellow color.
